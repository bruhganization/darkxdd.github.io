    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>
      Python is a popular and versatile programming language. It is used for a wide range of purposes, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python is known for its simplicity and readability. It uses indentation to indicate blocks of code, which makes it easy to understand and write. It also has a large and active community, which provides extensive support and a wealth of libraries and frameworks to extend its capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some key features of Python include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Dynamically-typed:</span> Python uses dynamic typing, which means that you don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it. The type is inferred at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Interpreted:</span> Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed directly by the interpreter without the need for compilation. This makes it easy to write and test Python code quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Object-oriented:</span> Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it uses objects and classes to organize and structure code. This allows you to model real-world entities and their relationships in your code, which makes it more modular and reusable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Whether you are a beginner looking to learn programming, or an experienced developer looking for a versatile and powerful language, Python is a great choice.
